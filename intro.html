                <h2>Welcome to Our DNA Robotics Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the advent of DNA origami in the 1980s, scientists have been pushing the limits of what we can achieve at the nanoscale. The use of DNA, given its well-known programmability and physical properties, has enabled us to pursue the creation of complex nano machines. DNA robots are one such machine, with the potential to carry out highly specific tasks. Our team has chosen to pursue the development of these robots, which we believe have the potential to _____________. Previous iterations of DNA robots have been designed with more limited functionality in terms of their movement and ability to carry out tasks. Our model has been developed with the aim of performing cargo sorting along with extended movement capabilities.
                </p>
                <h3>Rationale Behind Our Research</h3>
                <p>
                    The design and synthesis of molecular robots presents two critical challenges, those of modularity and algorithm simplicity, which have been transformative in other areas of molecular engineering. For example, simple and modular building blocks have been used for scaling up molecular information processing with DNA circuits. As in DNA circuits, simple building blocks for DNA robots could enable more complex nanomechanical tasks, whereas modularity could allow diverse new functions performed by robots using the same set of building blocks.
                </p>
                <h3>Our Achievements</h3>
                <p>
                    We demonstrate a DNA robot that performs a nanomechanical task substantially more sophisticated than previous work. We developed a simple algorithm and three modular building blocks for a DNA robot that performs autonomous cargo sorting. The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers each type to a specified destination until all cargo molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is designed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same task.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion and Future Prospects</h3>
                <p>
                    Using aptamers, antibodies, or direct conjugation, small chemicals, metal nanoparticles, and proteins could be transported as cargo molecules so that the cargo-sorting DNA robots could have potential applications in autonomous chemical synthesis, in manufacturing responsive molecular devices, and in programmable therapeutics. The building blocks developed in this work could also be used for diverse functions other than cargo sorting. For example, inspired by ant foraging, adding a new building block for leaving pheromone-like signals on a path, DNA robots could be programmed to find the shortest path and efficiently transport cargo molecules. With simple communication between the robots, they could perform even more sophisticated tasks. With more effort in developing modular and collective molecular robots, and with simple and systematic approaches, molecular robots could eventually be easily programmed like macroscopic robots, but working in microscopic environments.
