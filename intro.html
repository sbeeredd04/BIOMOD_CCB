                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    The past few decades have seen varying approaches to the bottom-up construction of structures on the nanoscale. Constructing 3D nanostructures that have dynamic motion capabilities and the ability to carry out elementary tasks has the potential to bring about novel methods of drug delivery in the field of medicine. Yet in order to facilitate the bottom-up construction of such devices, identifying feasible components is necessary. For this reason, DNA has emerged as a basic unit in the construction of nanostructures, leading to the growth of a field termed “DNA nanotechnology.”
                </p>

                <p>
                    The structure of DNA has been well-documented. The Watson-Crick model of DNA demonstrates the complementary base-pairing of nucleotides that allow for the formation of a double helix. These nucleotides, consisting of a nitrogenous base, sugar, and phosphate group, form hydrogen bonds among themselves. Adenine (A) will bind with Thymine (T), while Cytosine (C) binds to Guanine (G). 
                </p>

                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>
                    The human body can contract bacterial infections from a variety of external sources. These bacteria can rapidly proliferate throughout the body, causing a multitude of infections. While there has been a steady development of drugs and antibiotics to combat these infections, these conventional methods of drug delivery often fall short. These drugs often suffer from poor bioavailability, meaning the proportion of drugs that reach their target compared to those introduced into the body is low. Essentially, there are limitations to the specificity of these drugs in relation to their intended target. Further, given that these drugs are introduced to the entirety of the body, there may often be unintended side effects to other organs and tissues.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In order to approach this issue, it is vital to consider these drawbacks. A more targeted method of drug delivery would ideally have greater specificity, therefore ensuring that the drug of choice would reach its target area while limiting harm to other areas of the body. Such a solution would have to be more controllable in terms of the manner in which the drug is delivered to its target site. Therefore, we propose cargo-sorting DNA robots with the potential to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks of conventional drug delivery.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Solution</h2>
                <p>
                    Our cargo-sorting robot is designed to sort cargo on a DNA origami track and deliver it to a predetermined goal. Through the use of DNA origami, we were able to design these structures on the nanoscale.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Our DNA robot begins at a start strand on the origami track. It then traverses a track consisting of alternating track types in a random walk. Upon walking into cargo placed on points along the track, it picks it up and then proceeds with its random walk until reaching a goal strand for the cargo. In this manner, it is capable of sorting varying types of cargo along a 12-hour timescale. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    We believe that this robot could have potential in targeted drug delivery. By designing our goal strand to have aptamers complementary to the surface of bacteria, we could enable our origami to bind to harmful bacteria. Our DNA robot could then carry “cargo”, or the drug of choice to fight the bacteria, to the goal strand. While the possibility of using the cargo-sorting robot in drug delivery remains a relatively unexplored area, it is clear that there is potential for growth in this area.
                </p>

                <h2>Goals of the Project</h2>
                <p>
                    To approach the development of the DNA robot, we had to set several goals to ensure our continued progress. Thus, we decided on the following goals:
