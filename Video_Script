Find out the problem statement 
Present the solution using the stuff from the experiment 


DNA robots could have potential applications in autonomous chemical synthesis, in manufacturing responsive molecular devices, and in programmable therapeutics
DNA robots could be programmed to find the shortest path and efficiently transport cargo molecules. With simple communication between the robots, they could perform even more sophisticated tasks. With more effort in developing modular and collective molecular robots, and with simple and systematic approaches, molecular robots could eventually be easily programmed like macroscopic robots, but working in microscopic environments.
Find out a situation where this can be applied and used 



show a detailed animation video to show the uses of the dna robot 



conclude with a successful demonstration of solving the problem
