                    <p>
                        The following are the different versions of our cargo sorting DNA robot.
                    </p>
                    <div class = "version-1">
                        <h2>
                            Version 1
                        </h2>
                        <p> For our first version of CsDna we chose 5nm distance for the fiduciary markers and these are the results we found. Although we were able to see the origami form there were several concerns 1 the origami were aggregating together and second the paint wasn't clear because the fiduciary marker were closer which caused the pain to show clumps</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "version-2">
                        <h2>
                            Version 2
                        </h2>
                        <p> For our second version of CsDna we chose to add poly T to solve the problem of aggregation. but the clumping problem was yet to be solved this took use to our next version version 3</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "version-3">
                        <h2>
                            Version 3
                        </h2>
                        <p> For our third version of CsDna we chose to have 10nm distance. Although the image was better this time it wasn't good enough compared to our 20nm paint hence we decided to change the distance from 10 to 20nm for our next version</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "version-4">
                        <h2>
                            Version 4
                        </h2>
                        <p> For our fourth version of CsDna we chose to have 20nm distance. This was the best version we had so far. The paint was clear and the origami were not aggregating together. But we still have to figure our robot as there was a blur inside the origami because the robot weren't inhibhited pre-annealing </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class = "version-5">
