                        In order to produce high-quality images of our csDNA and robot, we had to go through several iterations of origami. We initially had to manage aggregation of our csDNA, prompting us to add polyTs and a loop cover. We then increased the distance between the fiduciary markers from 5 nm to 20 nm. Finally, we incorporated the robot into the csDNA as well. Below, we describe the experiments that allowed us to reach this point.

                            Our initial experiments were of csDNA without polyTs or the loop cover. We wanted to determine how well our csDNA was forming under standard conditions. Below are AFM images of our csDNA.

                            After verifying that our csDNA was forming under the AFM microscope we decided to turn our attention to DNA-PAINT. In order to test how successful our DNA-PAINT was, we first imaged 20nm grids, a 4x3 grid of fiduciary markers. Once we could optimize DNA-PAINT imaging, we could then begin imaging our csDNA with the same protocol. Below are images of our DNA-PAINT for the 20nm grid.

                            Our initial csDNA design had 5 nm distances between all the fiduciary markers. While these images verified that our csDNA was compatible with DNA-PAINT, it was impossible to distinguish between the fiduciary markers due to the small distance between the individual markers. The significant overlap between the markers prompted us to increase the distance four-fold to 20 nm.

                            The next step was incorporating the robot into our current csDNA. To do so, we annealed the robot separately and purified it with AMICON purification. We then added that to the csDNA at a 1:1 ratio and annealed the mix. With this method, we were able to see robots binding to the csDNA at high rates. Below is an image of our csDNA with robots, as well as the statistics for the number of robots binding to the track.

                            The results that we have achieved so far are promising with regards to the continued development of the DNA robot. We hope to continue this project by capturing our robot in motion and then introducing cargo. Further exploration may include optimizing the robot algorithm, as well as introducing more robots onto a single origami. It is clear that the cargo-sorting robot has the potential to have applications in a variety of fields, from medicine to nanoelectronics.

                            Discussion
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            On a short-term scale, the DNA robot has proven to be capable of sorting various cargo. However, there is potential to further the applications of the robot in the future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While the current model allows for the robot to proceed in a random walk, further optimizing the algorithm for the robot’s motion could ensure that the cargo is sorted even faster than what has currently been achieved. Adjusting the sequences of track strands to lower the binding energy between the track and robot could allow for faster dissociation from the track, thus allowing for greater speed. Further, by changing the complementary nature of certain strands, it could be possible to prompt the robot to travel on a defined path, rather than continuing a random walk.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In order to make the sorting of cargo more efficient, scaling up the number of robots could allow for a sort of swarm intelligence, similar to that of ants. Having robots working side-by-side could deliver cargo at higher rates. This may be used in the transportation of molecules, with potential use in chemical synthesis, or to rearrange circuit components on the nanoscale.
