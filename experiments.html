                        Synthesizing DNA origami in a lab environment is a multi-step process. It is necessary to do so to observe how our origami is forming, which will determine its efficacy and possible applications in the future. Below we outline our steps and the protocols for constructing our csDNA.

Upon aliquoting the individual DNA strands, we anneal our origami in a PCR machine to ensure that it forms together. It then undergoes purification to filter out any remaining single-stranded DNA. The origami can then be used for imaging preparation in a process called flow. Image made in BioRender.</p>

Our robot and inhibitor complex were annealed separately. The robot and inhibitor were added at a 1:1 ratio and diluted with 10X TAE and MQ water. This complex was heated to 90 °C in 5 minutes and then cooled to 4 °C at a rate of 0.1 °C every 19.2 seconds.

This was repeated 3 times to purify our solution.

This was repeated 3 times to purify our solution.

To capture single-color DNA-PAINT for our samples, we used the green channel, the wavelength of which corresponded to that of our Cy3B dye. The imaging settings we used are as follows:

                    We purchased our imager strands and dyes separately from IDT. In order to have imager strands ready for use in DNA-PAINT, it was necessary to conjugate them together. The steps for dye conjugation are outlined below:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Add dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO), an aprotic solvent, to Cy3b fluorophore NHS ester. Add 1x to a 10x solution to create a standard solution of 1 mg/ml solution.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Dilute the imager solution to 1mM by adding LCMS water. The imager strand-to-fluorophore ratio should be 1:10.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The product should be diluted to 40 μl using LCMS water. The imager concentration should be 0.5 μM. Add sodium bicarbonate to the imager strand solution at 0.1x concentration.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Add the fluorophore and DMSO mix in a 500 μl tube. Vortex the solution and mix continuously. Add water drop by drop to avoid an exothermic reaction that will result in evaporation of the fluorophores.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Cover the solution using parafilm and keep it in the Eppendorf Thermomixer for 18 hours at 30 ℃ at 900 RPM.

                <p>
                    After conjugating the dye, we had to perform HPLC purification to isolate the different oligonucleotides based on their physical properties. The steps of HPLC purification are explained below:

                    <li>
                        The HPLC machine (1260 Infinity II, Agilent) consists of 5 modules - A) Quaternary Palm B) Sample Injector C) Column Oven D) Multiple Wavelength Detector E) Fraction Collector. Upon completing the conjugation reaction, the sample is stored in the injection pump at A1.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The hydrophobic column is connected to the quaternary pump, which is connected to the solvents TEAA (Tris Ammonium Acetate - hydrophilic) and Acetonitrile (hydrophobic). 1.5 ml tubes are added to the fraction collector to collect samples.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The quaternary pump flows TEAA for 25 minutes with 95% solvent flow. The column is then cleaned with 100% acetonitrile, and equilibrium is maintained at 5% TEAA and 95% acetonitrile.

                    <li>
                        The Multiple Wavelength Detector has wavelengths set to 260 and 280 nm for DNA amine and 500 nm for Cy3b (which can vary depending on the absorbance peaks of the fluorophore).
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        Fraction Collector method and signals are set along with threshold to 100 mAU (milli absorbance unit) to filter out buffers and other contents, to concentrate fluorophores and DNA amines.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        The analytic run is 15 μl or 3 nanomoles. Upon completing the process, the rest of the sample is injected and the method is run again.

                </ol>

                <p>
                    Once HPLC purification is completed, the following steps are carried out to collect a final stock of imager strands.

                    <li>
                        The imager strands are freeze dried by placing the sample in dry ice and then in a vacuum pump overnight.

                    <li>
                        Nanodrop analysis is carried out to determine the concentration of the imager. MQ water is added to dilute the sample to the required concentration.
