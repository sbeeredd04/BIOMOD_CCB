            <h2>Welcome to Our DNA Robotics Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Since the advent of DNA origami in the 1980s, scientists have been pushing the limits of what we can achieve at the nanoscale. The use of DNA, given its well-known programmability and physical properties, has enabled us to pursue the creation of complex nano machines. DNA robots are one such machine, with the potential to carry out highly specific tasks. Our team has chosen to pursue the development of these robots, which we believe have the potential to _____________. Previous iterations of DNA robots have been designed with more limited functionality in terms of their movement and ability to carry out tasks. Our model has been developed with the aim of performing cargo sorting along with extended movement capabilities.
            </p>
            <h3>Rationale Behind Our Research</h3>
            <p>
                The design and synthesis of molecular robots presents two critical challenges, those of modularity and algorithm simplicity, which have been transformative in other areas of molecular engineering. For example, simple and modular building blocks have been used for scaling up molecular information processing with DNA circuits. As in DNA circuits, simple building blocks for DNA robots could enable more complex nanomechanical tasks, whereas modularity could allow diverse new functions performed by robots using the same set of building blocks.
            </p>
            <h3>Our Achievements</h3>
            <p>
                We demonstrate a DNA robot that performs a nanomechanical task substantially more sophisticated than previous work. We developed a simple algorithm and three modular building blocks for a DNA robot that performs autonomous cargo sorting. The robot explores a two-dimensional testing ground on the surface of DNA origami, picks up multiple cargos of two types that are initially at unordered locations, and delivers each type to a specified destination until all cargo molecules are sorted into two distinct piles. The robot is designed to perform a random walk without any energy supply. Exploiting this feature, a single robot can repeatedly sort multiple cargos. Localization on DNA origami allows for distinct cargo-sorting tasks to take place simultaneously in one test tube or for multiple robots to collectively perform the same task.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusion and Future Prospects</h3>
            <p>
                Using aptamers, antibodies, or direct conjugation, small chemicals, metal nanoparticles, and proteins could be transported as cargo molecules so that the cargo-sorting DNA robots could have potential applications in autonomous chemical synthesis, in manufacturing responsive molecular devices, and in programmable therapeutics. The building blocks developed in this work could also be used for diverse functions other than cargo sorting. For example, inspired by ant foraging, adding a new building block for leaving pheromone-like signals on a path, DNA robots could be programmed to find the shortest path and efficiently transport cargo molecules. With simple communication between the robots, they could perform even more sophisticated tasks. With more effort in developing modular and collective molecular robots, and with simple and systematic approaches, molecular robots could eventually be easily programmed like macroscopic robots, but working in microscopic environments.

            <h3>Background</h2>
            <p>
                The design of our cargo-sorting DNA robot was inspired by the work of Lulu Qian, Erik Winfree, and co-workers, who in 2017 demonstrated the first DNA-based robot. Here, a DNA-based robot traversed a DNA origami track constructed with alternating track types in a random walk. The robot’s role was to sort two different types of cargo and deliver them to “goal” strands.

            <h2>Anatomy of the Robot</h2>
            <p>
                The DNA robot itself was a single-stranded DNA of length 53 nucleotides, segmented into 6 sections. From base to top, the robot had a docking strand, foot #1, a leg, foot #2, an arm, and a hand. Each section consisted of a distinct DNA sequence to ensure highly targeted binding when the robot encountered strands complementary to its own “body parts”. Through the creation of unique parts each with a specific purpose, we were able to ensure that the robot could carry out tasks in the desired manner. For instance, the leg and feet of the robot facilitated its movement, while the arm and hand provided a mechanism for the robot to pick up and drop cargo. In this manner, the entirety of the robot served crucial roles in the process of sorting cargo.
            </p>

            <h2>Initial Condition of the Robot</h2>
                <p>
                    Prior to the addition of the robot to the system, the robot was inhibited to the start staple. This was necessary to confirm that only one robot would bind to a given origami track, thus preventing aggregation of multiple robots on a single origami. The inhibitor strand possessed a hand*, arm* and a foot* complement, thereby binding to relevant parts of the robot. On the addition of a trigger strand, complementary to the inhibitor, into the system, the inhibitor dissociated to the trigger, thus permitting the robot to begin its motion along the track.
                </p>

            <h2>Track Type</h2>
            <p>
                In order to facilitate the constant movement of the robot, it was necessary to construct two different track types. The track types differed solely in terms of the position of the feet and legs; track type #1 had a leg* and foot* respectively, while track type #2 had a foot* followed by a leg*. The tracks were laid out along the origami such that they constantly alternated. By having different arrangements of the legs and feet, the tracks allowed the robot to seamlessly transition between the two track types and continue its random walk without obstruction.
            </p>

            <h2>Motion of the Robot</h2>
            <p>
                The motion of the robot can be compared to that of a domino chain reaction; by pushing the top of one, the rest of the domino is compelled to follow. The diagram below represents the robot’s motion by demonstrating how it moves from one track type to another. Initially, foot #1 and the leg are bound to their complements, while foot #2 remains free. However, foot #2 begins to bind to its complement on the second track type, and the leg and foot #1 are compelled to follow. Essentially, by constantly having one foot of the robot unbound, we were able to allow the robot to constantly continue its random walk. The robot will be fully incapacitated once it reaches the goal strand, where all its feet and its leg will be bound to their respective complements, creating a stable complex.

            <h2>Transporting Cargo</h2>
            <p>
                As outlined earlier, the robot was designed with the purpose of transporting cargo across the DNA origami track. The cargo is a single-stranded DNA partitioned into four parts - the cargo identifier, an arm* complement, a hand* complement and a goal attacher*. The identifier allows the cargo to be recognized by the goal, while the arm* and hand* allow the cargo to be picked up by the robot. The goal attacher’s role is to bind the cargo to the goal strand. As the robot carries out its random walk, it meets the cargo along its path. The hand and the arm of the robot bind to their complements on the cargo, and the robot is now bound with cargo. The robot continues with its walk until it bumps into the designated cargo goal strand. Hence, the cargo’s hand*, arm* and identifier bind to the goal strand, indicating that the cargo has been deposited at the desired strand. The cargo is designed such that it has the capacity to carry molecules, augmenting its potential for use in drug delivery in medicine and other related fields.
